If the Distributed Repository (DR) assigned to the McAfee/Trellix agent does not have the package when you create a task to distribute it, the following can happen:  

1. **Agent Fallback to Master Repository (if allowed)** – If the agent's policy allows it, the agent will attempt to retrieve the package from the Master Repository instead of the DR.  
2. **Task Failure or Delay** – If the package is not available in any accessible repository, the deployment task may fail, or it may be delayed until the package is replicated to the DR.  
3. **Repository Sync Needed** – If the DR is missing the package, an administrator must ensure that replication is properly set up so the package is copied from the Master Repository to the DR.  

To prevent issues, ensure that the package is successfully replicated to all necessary DRs before deploying it. You can check the **Repository Status** in the ePO console to verify availability.
