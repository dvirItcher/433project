Using domain-based authentication (like OAuth, SAML, or LDAP) for your application has several pros and cons compared to building a custom authentication system. Here’s a breakdown of the two approaches:

### Pros of Domain-Based Authentication

1. **Enhanced Security**: Established domain-based authentication systems come with high-level security protocols, reducing the chances of vulnerabilities in your application. They often include multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and encryption, which would be challenging to implement from scratch.

2. **Easier Compliance**: Standards like OAuth and SAML are often compliant with industry regulations, making it easier to meet data security requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. 

3. **User Convenience**: Users can sign in with a single set of credentials for multiple applications. This is beneficial in environments with Single Sign-On (SSO) needs, reducing the hassle of managing multiple passwords.

4. **Reduced Maintenance**: Domain-based authentication providers regularly update security features, so you don’t have to handle issues like session management, token refreshing, and password hashing directly.

5. **Quick Integration**: Implementing domain-based authentication often takes less time than building a custom solution from scratch. Services like Firebase, Okta, and Auth0 provide SDKs and APIs that simplify the setup process.

### Cons of Domain-Based Authentication

1. **Dependency on External Services**: Relying on an external authentication service means you're subject to their availability and any potential downtimes or rate limits. If the service goes down, your application could be impacted.

2. **Cost**: Many domain-based authentication providers charge based on usage or per user. If your application scales, these costs can increase.

3. **Less Flexibility**: Domain-based solutions often follow a set protocol, limiting customization. For example, unique authentication requirements may not be supported or would require complex workarounds.

4. **Learning Curve**: Although domain-based solutions are documented, they still require understanding the authentication framework and integrating it with your application, which may involve a learning curve for your team.

5. **Data Control**: Some domain-based services store user data on their own servers, which may raise privacy concerns or conflict with your data governance policies.

### Pros of Building Custom Authentication

1. **Complete Control**: You can design the authentication system to meet specific requirements, allowing for full customization in terms of user experience and security.

2. **No Third-Party Costs**: By managing the authentication in-house, you avoid the recurring costs of third-party services.

3. **Flexibility**: A custom-built system can be adjusted to fit exactly what your application needs, which is beneficial if you need non-standard authentication flows or data handling.

### Cons of Building Custom Authentication

1. **Security Risks**: Building a secure authentication system is complex and requires expertise to avoid vulnerabilities. Mistakes in design could expose user data to attacks.

2. **Time and Effort**: Developing a reliable authentication system from scratch can take considerable time and resources, both initially and for ongoing maintenance.

3. **Compliance Challenges**: Ensuring compliance with security standards and regulations can be difficult without the expertise and resources provided by domain-based solutions.

4. **Scalability**: Custom solutions may struggle to scale as easily as domain-based systems, which are designed to handle large volumes of users and provide features like load balancing and rate limiting out of the box.

In general, domain-based authentication is typically a more secure and scalable choice unless you have specific requirements that justify the time and expense of building a custom solution.
