Your error suggests that your **Sysmon** configuration file is using a newer schema than your installed Sysmon version supports. Since **Event ID 26** (DNS Query Cancellation) was introduced in **Sysmon 14.16**, you need to make sure your Sysmon installation is **up to date** and supports **Schema 4.81**. Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

### **Solution 1: Update Sysmon to the Latest Version**
1. Download the latest **Sysmon** version from the official Microsoft Sysinternals website:  
   [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
2. Extract and replace your current **sysmon.exe** and **sysmon64.exe**.
3. Reinstall Sysmon with the new binary:  
   ```powershell
   sysmon -u
   sysmon -accepteula -i <your_config.xml>
   ```
4. Run your config file again:  
   ```powershell
   sysmon -c <your_config.xml>
   ```

### **Solution 2: Check Your Sysmon Schema Version**
1. Run the following command to check your current schema version:  
   ```powershell
   sysmon -s
   ```
2. If the schema version is **lower than 4.81**, update Sysmon as shown in **Solution 1**.

### **Solution 3: Adjust Your Config to Match Your Sysmon Version**
If you **cannot** update Sysmon but still need to apply the config, you can **downgrade your configuration file** by removing **Event ID 26** and any other unsupported features. This requires modifying your XML config file manually.
