To **stop or close Trellix ENS services** on a system, you typically **cannot just stop them normally**, because ENS is designed to **protect itself from tampering**, even by local administrators. However, there are **authorized ways** to temporarily stop or disable ENS services for troubleshooting or maintenance.

Here are your options, based on your role and purpose:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Option 1: Using Trellix ePO (recommended and centralized)**

If you manage endpoints via **Trellix ePO (ePolicy Orchestrator)**:

1. **Create a client task** to stop or uninstall ENS modules.
2. Go to:
   - **Menu > Client Tasks Catalog**
   - Choose the product (**McAfee Endpoint Security**) and task type (**Product Deployment** or **Custom**).
   - Set action to **"Stop"**, **"Disable"**, or **"Uninstall"** depending on the goal.
3. Assign the task to the target system or system group.
4. Run the task immediately or schedule it.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Option 2: On a local machine (with permission)**

1. **Access with Administrator rights**.
2. **Disable Self-Protection first:**
   - Open **Endpoint Security Console**.
   - Go to **Settings > General > Self-Protection**.
   - Uncheck or disable it (may require a password if enforced).
3. Then try stopping the services using `services.msc` or:

   **Via Command Line (Admin):**
   ```cmd
   net stop "McAfee Endpoint Security Platform"
   net stop "McAfee Endpoint Security Threat Prevention"
   net stop "McAfee Endpoint Security Firewall"
   net stop "McAfee Endpoint Security Web Control"
   ```

   If you‚Äôre unsure of the exact names, list all McAfee/Trellix services with:
   ```cmd
   sc queryex type= service | findstr /I "mcafee"
   ```

4. If ENS is actively protected, these commands will **fail unless self-protection is disabled**.

### üîê If you can't disable self-protection:

You won‚Äôt be able to stop ENS unless:
- You have the **administrative password** or access rights.
- You're using **ePO with the correct policies**.
- The system is in **managed mode** and not enforcing **tamper protection**.

Would you like a PowerShell script or batch file to automate this, assuming you have the right access?
