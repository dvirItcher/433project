If the McAfee Pre-Installation Auditor (PIA) showed no warnings or errors, but the ePO setup is still rolling back, the issue might be more nuanced. Here are additional steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

---

### **1. Review Setup Log Files in Detail**
- Go to the ePO installation logs:
  ```
  %temp%\McAfeeLogs
  ```
- Look specifically in the **`epo-install.log`** or **`orion.log`** for lines such as:
  - `ERROR`
  - `FATAL`
  - `Rollback initiated`
- Share the key log snippets if you're unsure how to interpret them.

---

### **2. Check Windows Event Viewer**
- Open Event Viewer:
  ```
  Start > Search "Event Viewer" > Windows Logs > Application
  ```
- Look for entries related to the installer during the time of the rollback.
  - Errors from `MsiInstaller` or `.NET` are common culprits.

---

### **3. Verify SQL Database Settings**
- Ensure the database:
  - Is **SQL Server Standard/Enterprise** (Express isn't supported for production).
  - Has **Mixed Mode Authentication** enabled.
  - Accepts connections from the ePO server (check with SQL Management Studio).
- Test the SQL connection using the same credentials provided during the setup.

---

### **4. Clear Temporary Files**
- Clear remnants of previous installations:
  1. Delete everything in the `%temp%` folder.
  2. Remove the partially created installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\McAfee\ePolicy Orchestrator`).

---

### **5. Confirm .NET Framework Compatibility**
- Ensure the required .NET Framework version is installed (ePO often requires specific versions like **.NET 4.7.x** or higher).
- Use the following to repair or reinstall:
  - `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`
  - `sfc /scannow`

---

### **6. Check for Third-Party Interference**
- Temporarily disable:
  - Antivirus/Endpoint Protection software.
  - Group Policy restrictions.
- Ensure no conflicting services (e.g., older McAfee services or other security software) are running.

---

### **7. Use a Fresh SQL Database Instance**
- If previous installation attempts partially configured the database, it could cause rollbacks.
  - Delete the existing database or create a new, clean instance.

---

### **8. Manually Create Required Directories**
- Sometimes, the installer fails due to permission issues or missing directories.
- Pre-create these directories (if applicable) and assign **Full Control** to the installation user:
  - `C:\Program Files\McAfee\ePolicy Orchestrator`
  - `C:\ProgramData\McAfee`

---

### **9. Reinstall Prerequisites**
Reinstall critical components like:
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables (ensure both x86 and x64 versions are installed for 2010, 2013, 2015, 2019).
- Ensure the Windows Installer service is running:
  ```
  net start msiserver
  ```

---

### **10. Advanced Debugging with Verbose MSI Logs**
- Run the installer with verbose logging:
  ```
  msiexec /i "ePOSetup.msi" /L*v "C:\epo-verbose-log.txt"
  ```
- This creates a detailed log (`epo-verbose-log.txt`) that may pinpoint the exact step causing the rollback.
