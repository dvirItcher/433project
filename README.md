Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) includes several default server tasks designed to automate and streamline various administrative and maintenance operations. Here are five key default server tasks:

1. **AutoUpdate**: This task automatically retrieves and applies the latest updates for installed security products, ensuring that all managed systems are protected with the most current threat definitions and software enhancements.

2. **Extract Events**: This task processes and transfers collected event data from managed systems to the ePO database. By doing so, it enables administrators to monitor and analyze security events effectively.

3. **Inactive Agents Cleanup**: This task identifies and removes agents that have not communicated with the ePO server within a specified timeframe. This helps maintain an accurate representation of active systems within the network.

4. **Server Maintenance**: This task performs routine maintenance activities on the ePO server, such as purging old data, optimizing database performance, and ensuring the overall health of the server environment.

5. **Software Product Deployment**: This task automates the distribution and installation of software products and updates to managed systems. It ensures that all endpoints have the necessary security software installed and are up to date.

These default server tasks can be customized to align with specific organizational policies and operational requirements, providing flexibility in managing the security infrastructure.
