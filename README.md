Yes, the **Print Spooler** service maintains its own set of logs within Windows, separate from the standard Windows Security and System logs. These logs are part of the **PrintService** operational logs and can provide valuable insights when monitoring for suspicious activities, such as attempts to exploit the **PrintNightmare** vulnerability.

### **PrintService Operational Logs**

The **PrintService** logs can be found in the **Event Viewer** under:

```
Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PrintService > Operational
```

These logs capture detailed information about print jobs, driver installations, and other spooler-related activities.

### **Relevant Event IDs**

While you mentioned **Event ID 316** and **808**, it's important to clarify their significance:

- **Event ID 808**: This event is logged when a **printer driver is installed**. Monitoring this can help detect unauthorized or suspicious driver installations, which could be a vector for exploitation.

- **Event ID 316**: This event ID is not standard within the **PrintService** operational logs. It's possible there might be a typo or confusion with another event ID. However, other relevant event IDs to monitor include:
  - **Event ID 307**: Indicates a document has been printed.
  - **Event ID 805**: Denotes a printer has been deleted.
  - **Event ID 819**: Represents a change in printer properties.
  - **Event ID 820**: Relates to the installation of a new printer.

### **Detecting PrintNightmare Using PrintService Logs**

To effectively monitor for **PrintNightmare** attempts using the **PrintService** logs alongside **Windows Security** and **Sysmon** logs, follow these steps:

#### **1. Enable PrintService Operational Logging**

Ensure that the **PrintService** operational log is enabled:

1. Open **Event Viewer**.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PrintService > Operational
   ```
3. Right-click on **Operational** and select **Enable Log** if it's not already enabled.

#### **2. Monitor Specific Event IDs**

Focus on the following event IDs within the **PrintService** logs:

- **Event ID 808**: Monitor for unexpected printer driver installations.
- **Event ID 307**: Track unusual or frequent print jobs that may indicate exploitation attempts.
- **Event ID 805, 819, 820**: Watch for deletion or modification of printers and their properties.

#### **3. Correlate with Windows Security and Sysmon Logs**

Combining **PrintService** logs with **Windows Security** and **Sysmon** logs enhances detection capabilities:

- **Windows Security Logs**:
  - **Event ID 7045**: New service installation (could indicate malicious service creation).
  - **Event ID 4688**: Process creation events (look for suspicious processes related to spooler exploitation).

- **Sysmon Logs**:
  - **Event ID 1**: Process creation (identify unusual processes like `rundll32.exe` or unexpected instances of `spoolsv.exe`).
  - **Event ID 3**: Network connections (detect unusual outbound connections from the spooler service).
  - **Event ID 10**: WMI execution (monitor for lateral movement attempts leveraging WMI).

#### **4. Example Detection Scenarios**

**a. Unauthorized Driver Installation**

An attacker may attempt to install a malicious printer driver to execute arbitrary code:

- **PrintService Log**:
  - **Event ID 808**: New printer driver installation.
  
- **Windows Security Log**:
  - **Event ID 7045**: A new service is installed concurrently.
  
- **Sysmon Log**:
  - **Event ID 1**: Process creation of `spoolsv.exe` spawning suspicious processes.

**b. Abnormal Print Job Activity**

Excessive or unusual print jobs might indicate an attempt to exploit the spooler:

- **PrintService Log**:
  - **Event ID 307**: Multiple unexpected print jobs.
  
- **Sysmon Log**:
  - **Event ID 3**: Unusual network connections originating from `spoolsv.exe`.
  
- **Windows Security Log**:
  - **Event ID 4688**: Processes like `rundll32.exe` or `powershell.exe` initiated by the spooler.

#### **5. Implementing Detection with PowerShell**

You can use PowerShell to query and filter these logs. Here's an example script to identify suspicious driver installations:

```powershell
# Query PrintService Operational Logs for Event ID 808
$printDrivers = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational" | 
    Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 808 }

foreach ($event in $printDrivers) {
    # Extract relevant information
    $timestamp = $event.TimeCreated
    $printerName = $event.Properties[0].Value
    $driverName = $event.Properties[1].Value
    $user = $event.Properties[2].Value

    # Output or further analyze the data
    Write-Output "[$timestamp] Printer Driver Installed: $driverName on Printer: $printerName by User: $user"
}
```

#### **6. Best Practices for Monitoring**

- **Regularly Review Logs**: Schedule periodic reviews of the **PrintService**, **Security**, and **Sysmon** logs.
- **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts in your SIEM or monitoring tool for critical event IDs and unusual patterns.
- **Harden the Print Spooler**:
  - Disable the Print Spooler service on servers where it's not needed.
  - Restrict permissions to manage printers and spooler settings.
- **Keep Systems Updated**: Ensure that all Windows systems are patched with the latest security updates to mitigate vulnerabilities like PrintNightmare.

### **Conclusion**

Monitoring the **PrintService** operational logs, along with **Windows Security** and **Sysmon** logs, provides a comprehensive approach to detecting and responding to **PrintNightmare** exploitation attempts. By focusing on specific event IDs and correlating activities across different log sources, you can enhance your security posture and swiftly identify potential threats targeting the Print Spooler service.
