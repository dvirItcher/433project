### Detailed Steps for Detecting PrintNightmare Exploits in PCAP Files

To detect signs of the PrintNightmare exploit in a PCAP file, focus on specific protocols, packet types, and activity patterns associated with the exploitation of the **Windows Print Spooler service**. Below are detailed indicators and traffic patterns to search for:

---

### **1. Protocols and Ports to Analyze**
- **SMB (Server Message Block):** Port 445
- **DCERPC (Distributed Computing Environment Remote Procedure Call):** Port 135
- **Named Pipes:** Look for interactions with `\\PIPE\spoolss`

---

### **2. Key Traffic Patterns**
#### **A. SMB Traffic**
- Look for SMB commands that interact with the `\\spool\drivers` directory. Attackers often use this path to drop malicious `.DLL` files for remote code execution.
- **Filters for SMB2 traffic:**
  - Check for suspicious file paths:
    ```
    smb2 && smb2.filename contains "\\spool\\drivers"
    ```
  - Check for `.DLL` file uploads:
    ```
    smb2 && smb2.filename contains ".dll"
    ```
- **Unusual Write Operations:**
  Look for SMB `Write` or `Create` operations with `.DLL` files.

#### **B. RPC Traffic**
- Look for RPC traffic specifically targeting the **Print Spooler** service. The RPC `Bind` requests will often reference the `MS-RPRN` or `MS-PAR` interfaces.
- **Filters for RPC traffic:**
  - Bind to `MS-RPRN` or `MS-PAR`:
    ```
    rpc && (rprn || par)
    ```
  - General RPC traffic on port 135:
    ```
    tcp.port == 135 && rpc
    ```

#### **C. Named Pipe Activity**
- Check for the named pipe `\\PIPE\spoolss`, which is used by the Windows Print Spooler service.
- Use this Wireshark filter:
  ```
  smb.pipe contains "spoolss"
  ```

---

### **3. Suspicious Behavior to Look For**
#### **A. DLL Injection or Driver Uploads**
- Attackers exploit PrintNightmare by uploading malicious DLLs to:
  ```
  \\<target_IP>\C$\Windows\System32\spool\drivers
  ```
- Look for `.DLL` files being created or written in the SMB traffic:
  ```
  smb2 && smb2.filename contains "\\spool\\drivers" && smb2.filename contains ".dll"
  ```

#### **B. Print Driver Installation Traffic**
- Attackers abuse print driver installation functionality to execute malicious code remotely.
- Check for unusual RPC calls involving the following:
  - **`AddPrinterDriverEx`**
  - **`RpcAddPrinterDriver`**

#### **C. Large SMB or RPC Payloads**
- PrintNightmare involves transferring malicious payloads. Watch for:
  - Large `Write` requests in SMB traffic.
  - Large payloads in RPC calls.

---

### **4. Other Indicators**
- **Time Patterns:** Unusual activity during off-hours, such as SMB writes to `spool\drivers` or RPC requests, may indicate an attack.
- **Repeated Attempts:** Multiple RPC `Bind` requests or failed SMB authentication attempts could signal brute-forcing.

---

### **5. Additional Analysis**
#### **A. Extract Files from PCAP**
- Use Wireshark or tools like **NetworkMiner** to extract `.DLL` files or other suspicious files uploaded via SMB. Analyze these files for malicious behavior.

#### **B. Check for Exploit Indicators in Logs**
If the attack succeeded, you might find:
- **DLL executions logged on the victim system.**
- Abnormal **print driver installation** activity.

#### **C. Cross-reference IPs**
- Compare the source/destination IPs in your PCAP with known attacker IPs from threat intelligence databases.

---

### **6. Wireshark Filters Overview**
Hereâ€™s a summary of key filters:
1. SMB traffic to `spool\drivers`:
   ```
   smb2 && smb2.filename contains "\\spool\\drivers"
   ```
2. RPC traffic (MS-RPRN or MS-PAR):
   ```
   rpc && (rprn || par)
   ```
3. Named pipes related to `spoolss`:
   ```
   smb.pipe contains "spoolss"
   ```
4. Port-based traffic:
   ```
   tcp.port == 445 || tcp.port == 135
   ```

---

### **7. Automate Detection with Zeek or Suricata**
- Zeek can extract and log metadata, such as SMB file writes or RPC calls.
- Example Suricata rule:
  ```plaintext
  alert tcp any any -> any 445 (msg:"Potential PrintNightmare Exploit"; content:"\\spool\\drivers"; nocase; content:".dll"; nocase; sid:12345;)
  ```

Would you like assistance with any specific tool (e.g., Wireshark, Zeek, or Suricata) or further details about analyzing certain packets?
