If your CentOS VM cannot connect to the repository, it might be due to network configuration issues. Here’s how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity**
1. Check if the VM has internet access:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 google.com
   ```
   - If this fails, your VM might not be connected to the internet. Move to **Step 2**.
   - If it succeeds, skip to **Step 3**.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Network for the VM**
1. **Ensure the Network Adapter is Enabled**:
   - Open your VM settings in your virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware).
   - Check that the network adapter is set to **NAT** or **Bridged Adapter**.

2. **Restart the Network Service in CentOS**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
   ```

3. **Manually Assign an IP (if needed)**:
   If your VM is not getting an IP address:
   ```bash
   sudo nmtui
   ```
   - Select **Edit a Connection** and configure your network interface.
   - Ensure it's set to **Automatically connect** and uses DHCP.

4. Recheck the connection:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 google.com
   ```

### **Step 3: Fix CentOS Repository Issues**
If your internet is working but the repository isn’t accessible:
1. **Ensure the Repository is Enabled**:
   Open the CentOS repo configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
   ```
   - Ensure `[base]`, `[updates]`, and `[extras]` repositories are not commented (lines do not start with `#`).
   - Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

2. **Clear and Rebuild the Yum Cache**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum clean all
   sudo yum makecache
   ```

3. **Update the Repository Configuration**:
   If CentOS 8 repos are unavailable, you can migrate to CentOS Stream or use alternative repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y centos-release-stream
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

4. Retry the `unrar` installation:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y epel-release
   sudo yum install -y unrar
   ```

### **Step 4: Use Offline Installation (Optional)**
If you still face issues, you can manually download the `unrar` RPM and install it:
1. Download the RPM on a machine with internet:
   - Visit [RPMFind](https://rpmfind.net/) or a similar site.
   - Search for `unrar` and download the appropriate version for CentOS.

2. Transfer the RPM to the VM (via SCP, shared folder, or USB).

3. Install the RPM:
   ```bash
   sudo rpm -ivh unrar*.rpm
   ```
