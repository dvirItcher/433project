In Trellix (formerly McAfee Enterprise), if you're dealing with **injection code related to certificates in the common policy**, you‚Äôre likely referring to how **policies are applied to endpoints** and how **scripts or code injections** might interact with **certificate validation**‚Äîespecially in the context of **web control, endpoint protection, or application control**.

Here‚Äôs how these components may tie together:

---

### üîê Certificates in Common Policy
In Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), **certificates** in common policies are typically used to:
- Ensure **trusted communication** between agents and servers.
- Define **trusted sources** for applications or web traffic.
- Sign **code or scripts** that are allowed to execute (especially in **Application Control** or **Dynamic Application Containment**).

---

### üíâ Injection Code Context
"Injection code" may refer to:
- **Custom scripts or rules** injected into endpoints via policies.
- **Potentially malicious code** trying to bypass security using trusted certificates.
- **White-listed applications** using signed certificates to gain elevated privileges.

---

### üìé How They Are Related
1. **Application Control Policies**:
   - You can **whitelist certificates** to allow code signed with them to run.
   - If malicious code is signed with a **trusted certificate**, it could bypass execution control.
   - Certificate whitelisting is often managed in the **common policy** area.

2. **Web Control / Proxy Policies**:
   - Code or script injections over HTTPS rely on **SSL inspection**.
   - Trellix can use a **certificate for SSL inspection** ‚Äì and if improperly configured, it might allow injected content to pass.

3. **Dynamic Application Containment (DAC)**:
   - Uses policies that might allow/block behavior based on certificate trust.
   - Code injection can be analyzed for behaviors, and if signed by a trusted cert (allowed in policy), it may not be contained.

---

### ‚úÖ What to Check
- **Common Policy Certificate Lists**: See what certificates are trusted under Application Control or Web Control.
- **Custom Script Injections**: Audit if scripts are being pushed via ePO or executed via allowed certs.
- **Rule Exceptions Based on Certs**: Are there exceptions that allow signed code to run without deeper inspection?

If you have a more specific context (like a particular module ‚Äì ENS, Web Control, etc.), I can dig deeper. Want to narrow it down a bit?
