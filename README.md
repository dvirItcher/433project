If you only have `wazuh-apid.py`, then you're likely using Wazuh 4.3 or later, where the API is now Python-based instead of Node.js. That means the service should be `wazuh-apid.service`, not `wazuh-api.service`.  

### **1. Check if `wazuh-apid` Service Exists**  
Run:  
```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep wazuh  
```
or  
```bash
systemctl status wazuh-apid
```
If the service is **not found**, it might not be enabled or installed correctly.  

---

### **2. Try Manually Running the API**  
Since you have `wazuh-apid.py`, try running it manually:  

```bash
python3 /var/ossec/api/scripts/wazuh-apid.py
```

- If this works, the API is fine, but the service is missing.
- If there’s an error, let me know what it says.

---

### **3. Reinstall and Enable the Wazuh API Service**  

If the service is missing, reinstall it:  

```bash
apt-get install --reinstall wazuh-api
```
Then, enable and start it:  

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-apid
systemctl start wazuh-apid
```

Check the status:  
```bash
systemctl status wazuh-apid
```

---

### **4. Check API Logs for Issues**  
If the API doesn’t start, check logs:  

```bash
cat /var/ossec/logs/api.log
```

Let me know what error messages you see!
