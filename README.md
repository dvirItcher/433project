Thanks for sharing the official Trellix documentation link. You're absolutely right ‚Äî the previous response was based on legacy McAfee SIR sources, which don't fully reflect Trellix‚Äôs updated version. Let's go directly from **the official Trellix SIR User Guide (PDF)** you linked.

## ‚úÖ **Trellix System Information Reporter (SIR) ‚Äì Overview (Based on Official User Guide)**

The **System Information Reporter (SIR)** is an ePO-integrated Trellix product that enables security and IT teams to **collect** and **report** crucial system configuration and event data from managed endpoints. It‚Äôs typically used to assist with **threat investigations**, **compliance auditing**, and **environment baselining**.

---

## üß† **Core Capabilities of SIR**

### 1. **ePO Integration**

* Fully integrated with **Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO)**.
* Can be centrally managed, configured, and updated via ePO.
* All operations (data collection, policy application, queries) are done through the ePO console.

### 2. **Data Collection**

SIR collects information from client systems using **three main policy types**:

#### A. **Registry Data**

* Gathers registry key and value data from Windows machines.
* Admins specify:

  * Hive (e.g., HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE)
  * Key path
  * Value name
  * Value type (e.g., string, DWORD)

#### B. **File Data**

* Searches files on endpoints to collect attributes:

  * File name
  * Version
  * Creation/Modified dates
  * Hash (MD5/SHA-1)

#### C. **Event Log Data**

* Collects entries from:

  * System logs
  * Application logs
  * Security logs
* Filters by:

  * Event ID
  * Source
  * Time window
  * Severity level

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Policy Management**

### 1. **Policy Types in ePO**

* **Registry Policy** ‚Äì define which registry entries to collect.
* **File Policy** ‚Äì define directories/files and attributes to report.
* **Event Log Policy** ‚Äì configure how logs are collected and filtered.

### 2. **Policy Enforcement**

* You can **assign policies** to systems or groups.
* SIR enforces collection based on these assignments.
* Collected data is **reported back to the ePO server**.

---

## üìä **Reporting and Queries**

* All collected data can be viewed in **custom or predefined queries**.
* Queries can show data such as:

  * Systems missing a registry key
  * Systems with a certain app installed
  * Event log activity related to security threats

### Examples:

* Query: Show all systems missing antivirus registry entry.
* Query: List endpoints where a suspicious file was found.
* Query: Collect all Event ID 4625 (failed login attempts).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Use Cases**

* **Threat Hunting:** Identify IOCs across systems using registry/file/event data.
* **Compliance Auditing:** Verify presence of required keys, software, or config.
* **Baseline Reporting:** Create a snapshot of systems‚Äô state and track changes.
* **Custom Checks:** Build policies to check for specific configurations or signs of compromise.

---

## üîê **Security Considerations**

* Only authorized ePO users with SIR permissions can create/edit policies or view results.
* You can create **role-based access controls** (RBAC) in ePO to limit SIR functions.

---

## üìÅ **Installation & Deployment Notes**

* SIR is deployed as an **endpoint agent extension** via ePO.
* The **SIR extension** and **client package** must both be installed in ePO.
* After that, you can assign tasks/policies to deploy and run SIR on endpoints.

---

## üîÑ **SIR Workflow Summary**

1. **Install SIR Extension & Package in ePO**
2. **Create Collection Policies** (File, Registry, Event Log)
3. **Assign Policies to Systems/Groups**
4. **Collect & Report Data from Endpoints**
5. **Use Queries & Dashboards to Analyze Data**

## üìò Documentation Details

From your provided [PDF guide](https://docs-be.trellix.com/bundle/system-information-reporter-user-guide/raw/resource/enus/system-information-reporter-user-guide.pdf), this version of SIR is:

* **More targeted toward security investigations**
* **Streamlined into ePO**
* **Focused on low-footprint data collection**
* No longer has older features like process/service inventory (those are now covered by other Trellix tools like ENS or HX).

---

## ‚ùó Important Notes & Limitations

* **Windows-only:** SIR is currently built for **Windows platforms**.
* **No automated remediation:** SIR is for **reporting only**, not enforcement.
* **No real-time alerts:** SIR works on scheduled collection intervals.

If you need specific examples (e.g., JSON/XML output, dashboards, queries) or want a breakdown of how to write effective registry or event log collection policies, let me know ‚Äî I can help create those or walk you through building them in ePO.
