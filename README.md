Yes, you need to register an LDAP server to perform AD sync in Trellix ePO. Here's why:

1. **LDAP acts as the connection point** – When you register an LDAP server, you're telling ePO where and how to connect to your Active Directory (since AD uses LDAP for directory access).  
2. **AD sync relies on the LDAP connection** – Once the LDAP server is registered, ePO can query the AD structure, pull user and group data, and reflect that information in the System Tree.  
3. **Credential validation** – The registered LDAP provides the authentication mechanism, allowing ePO to validate AD credentials and access the directory for sync operations.  

### **Process Overview:**
1. Register the LDAP server in ePO (provide domain controller address, port, and credentials).  
2. Configure AD Sync settings (select which OUs, users, and groups to sync).  
3. ePO pulls the data from AD through the registered LDAP connection.  

Without registering the LDAP server, ePO wouldn't know where to retrieve the AD data from, so AD sync wouldn't work.
