The `checkRevocation` value in Sysmon is a **boolean registry setting** that controls whether **certificate revocation checking** is enabled for Sysmon when validating digitally signed binaries. 

### Purpose of `checkRevocation`
When Sysmon processes events, it may need to verify the digital signatures of binaries or executables involved. This verification ensures that:
- The file is signed by a trusted entity.
- The certificate used for the signature is still valid and hasn't been revoked by the issuing certificate authority (CA).

The `checkRevocation` setting determines if Sysmon should perform this additional step of checking the **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)** or using **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)** during validation.

### Where `checkRevocation` is Found
The `checkRevocation` setting is usually stored in the Sysmon configuration under the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Sysmon\Config
```

It is part of the operational settings that influence how Sysmon processes and logs events.

---

### Possible Values
- **`0` (Disabled):**  
  Revocation checking is turned off. Sysmon will only verify if a binary is signed, but it won't check whether the signing certificate is revoked.

- **`1` (Enabled):**  
  Revocation checking is enabled. Sysmon will validate the signature and also check if the signing certificate has been revoked.

### Why `checkRevocation` Matters
1. **Enhanced Security:**  
   Enabling `checkRevocation` ensures Sysmon can detect binaries with invalid or revoked certificates, which may indicate tampering or malicious intent.

2. **Performance Considerations:**  
   - Enabling this option may introduce **performance overhead** because revocation checks often require contacting external servers (CRL distribution points or OCSP responders).
   - If the system has limited internet connectivity or the CA servers are unreachable, revocation checks may fail, resulting in delays or incomplete validation.

3. **Use Case Scenarios:**
   - **Enabled (`1`)** for high-security environments where signature validation is critical, and external connections for CRL/OCSP are reliable.
   - **Disabled (`0`)** for isolated systems or environments where performance is prioritized over signature revocation checks.

### How to Change `checkRevocation`
To modify this value, use the Sysmon command-line interface to reload the configuration or adjust it in the registry:

#### Using Sysmon CLI:
If you are updating your Sysmon configuration file (XML), include this option:

```xml
<Sysmon>
    <Options>
        <CheckRevocation>true</CheckRevocation>
    </Options>
</Sysmon>
```

Apply the updated configuration:
```cmd
sysmon.exe -c sysmonconfig.xml
```

#### Modifying the Registry Directly:
If you need to adjust the registry value directly:
1. Open **Regedit** and navigate to:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Sysmon\Config
   ```
2. Look for the `checkRevocation` value.
3. Set its data to:
   - `0` (Disabled)
   - `1` (Enabled)

4. Restart the Sysmon service to apply changes:
   ```cmd
   net stop sysmon
   net start sysmon
   ```

### Monitoring Impact of `checkRevocation`
- **Event Logs:** Enabling `checkRevocation` may result in additional information being logged in the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` channel if certificate issues are detected.
- **Error Handling:** If the revocation check fails due to connectivity issues or other reasons, Sysmon typically logs the failure but continues processing the event.
