To assess whether a computer is vulnerable to **PrintNightmare**, attackers (or ethical security researchers) would typically analyze system configurations, service versions, and patch levels. Below, I outline both scenarios: when you have access to the computer and when you don't.

---

### **Case 1: When You Have Access to the Computer**
With direct access, you can query the system for details about its Print Spooler configuration and patch level.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Check Windows Version and Build**:
   - Determine if the system is running an unpatched version of Windows.
   - Run:
     ```powershell
     systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
     ```
   - Compare the output with [Microsoft's security bulletin](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide) to see if the system is patched for **CVE-2021-34527**.

2. **Inspect Print Spooler Service**:
   - Verify if the Print Spooler service is running:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service -Name Spooler
     ```
   - Check its configuration:
     ```powershell
     Get-WmiObject Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Spooler" }
     ```
   - A running and enabled Print Spooler service could indicate potential vulnerability.

3. **Query Point and Print Policies**:
   - Assess the Point and Print restrictions using the registry:
     ```powershell
     reg query "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint"
     ```
   - Look for keys like `NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall`. If set to `1`, the system may be vulnerable.

4. **Check Installed Patches**:
   - Determine if the specific patches for PrintNightmare have been installed:
     ```powershell
     wmic qfe list | findstr "KB5004945 KB5005010 KB5005394"
     ```
   - If these KBs are missing, the system might be vulnerable.

### **Case 2: When You Donâ€™t Have Access to the Computer**
Without direct access, you would need to rely on external observations and network reconnaissance.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Scan for Open Print Spooler Ports**:
   - Use a tool like **nmap** to check if the Print Spooler service is exposed:
     ```bash
     nmap -p 445,135,139,593,3268 --script smb-enum-shares <target_ip>
     ```
   - Ports like 445 (SMB) or 135 (RPC) being open could indicate the Print Spooler is active.

2. **Enumerate SMB/RPC Services**:
   - Use a tool like **Impacket** to enumerate RPC services:
     ```bash
     rpcdump.py <target_ip>
     ```
   - Check for services related to the Print Spooler.

3. **Test for Vulnerability Remotely**:
   - Leverage exploit frameworks like **Metasploit** or **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts**:
     - Example:
       ```bash
       use exploit/windows/printnightmare/print_spooler
       set RHOST <target_ip>
       run
       ```
     - If the exploit succeeds, the target is vulnerable.

4. **Check SMB Signing and Authentication**:
   - If SMB signing is disabled or weak, attackers might exploit this to execute a PrintNightmare attack:
     ```bash
     smbclient -L <target_ip> -N
     ```
   - Lack of signing or secure authentication indicates potential vulnerability.

5. **Analyze Network Traffic**:
   - Use a packet capture tool like Wireshark to monitor RPC traffic.
   - If RPC calls related to the Print Spooler are visible, it indicates potential exposure.

### **Ethical Note**
These techniques are for **learning purposes** or conducting **authorized penetration tests** only. Unauthorized probing or exploitation of systems is illegal and unethical.
