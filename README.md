Detecting the **PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527)** from a PCAP file involves looking for specific network activity associated with exploitation attempts. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Understand the Exploit**
- PrintNightmare exploits the **Windows Print Spooler** service.
- Attackers may send malicious RPC traffic to the spooler service (via the `MS-RPRN` or `MS-PAR` protocols) over **SMB (port 445)** or **RPC (port 135)**.

---

### **2. Tools You'll Need**
- **Wireshark:** For packet analysis.
- **NetworkMiner** or **Zeek:** For extracting metadata or detecting patterns.
- **Suricata/Snort:** For IDS rules to detect malicious signatures.

---

### **3. Indicators to Look For**
#### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **RPC Bind Requests** to the Print Spooler:
   - Check for `MS-RPRN` or `MS-PAR` interfaces in the RPC `Bind` packets.
   - Look for packets on port **135** (RPC) or **445** (SMB).

2. **Suspicious SMB Traffic:**
   - Look for unusual **Create/Write** operations targeting `.DLL` files in the `\\spool\drivers` path.

3. **Abnormal Named Pipe Activity:**
   - Check for pipes like `\\PIPE\spoolss`.

4. **DLL Injection Attempts:**
   - Look for file uploads with `.DLL` extensions that are linked to driver installations.

#### **Wireshark Filters:**
- **RPC Traffic (MS-RPRN or MS-PAR)**:
  ```
  rpc && (rprn || par)
  ```
- **SMB Traffic with Suspicious File Paths**:
  ```
  smb2 && smb2.filename contains "\\spool\\drivers"
  ```
- **Port-Based Traffic**:
  ```
  tcp.port == 445 || tcp.port == 135
  ```

---

### **4. Using IDS Rules**
If using Suricata or Snort, you can load PrintNightmare-specific rules. For example:

```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 445 (msg:"Possible PrintNightmare Exploit"; content:"\\spool\\drivers"; nocase; sid:20211234; rev:1;)
```

---

### **5. Automating Analysis**
If you have Zeek installed, it can extract and log specific details about SMB or RPC activities. For example:
- Parse SMB file writes to check for `.DLL` uploads.
- Look for RPC calls to `MS-RPRN`.

---

### **6. Advanced: Manual Inspection**
If no automated tools are available, manually inspect the PCAP file in Wireshark:
1. Use the display filters above.
2. Check SMB/Named Pipe activity in detail for suspicious driver-related operations.
3. Cross-reference IP addresses for known attacker sources.
