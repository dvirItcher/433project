To stop **Sysmon** (System Monitor), you can use the following methods:

### 1. **Using the Sysmon Command Line**  
   Sysmon can be stopped by running the uninstall command from its own executable:
   ```cmd
   sysmon.exe -u
   ```
   - This completely removes Sysmon from the system.

---

### 2. **Stopping the Sysmon Service**  
   You can stop the Sysmon service directly through the Service Control Manager:
   ```cmd
   sc stop Sysmon
   ```
   - Note: This does not uninstall Sysmon but temporarily stops its operation.

---

### 3. **Using Task Manager or Taskkill**  
   If the Sysmon process is running, you can terminate it manually:
   - **Via Task Manager**: Locate the `Sysmon.exe` process and end it.
   - **Via Command Line**:
     ```cmd
     taskkill /IM sysmon.exe /F
     ```
   - Note: The service might restart automatically if it is configured to do so.
