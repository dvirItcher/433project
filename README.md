You don't need to add the EICAR file to Trellix ENS's signature database â€” **EICAR is already universally recognized by antivirus and endpoint protection software**, including Trellix (formerly McAfee ENS), as a **standard test file**.

### Hereâ€™s how it works:

**EICAR** (European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research) created this file as a harmless way to test antivirus software. It's a simple text string thatâ€™s detected as malicious by almost every antivirus solution without posing any risk.

### âœ… What you should do:

1. **Create the EICAR file manually:**
   - Open Notepad or any text editor.
   - Paste this string exactly:
     ```
     X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
     ```
   - Save the file as `eicar.com`.

2. **Run a scan with Trellix ENS:**
   - Either drop the file into a location that ENS actively scans.
   - Or manually trigger an **on-demand scan** from the ENS console targeting the file or folder containing it.

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Trellix ENS should detect and quarantine/delete the file automatically.
   - You can also check the **Threat Event Logs** or **ePO (if you're using it)** to confirm detection.

### ðŸ”’ Important Notes:
- **Do not rename or modify** the EICAR file or its contents, or it might not be detected.
- You can also test **real-time scanning** by just saving the file in a monitored folder (like Desktop) and watching ENS act.

Let me know if you want help checking detection in the logs or triggering different types of scans.
