Great questions — let’s break them down clearly:

---

### **1. What is the "Global Root" in Trellix ePO?**

The **Global Root** is the **top-level group** in the **System Tree**, usually named **"My Organization"**.

- All other groups (like department-specific ones: Finance, HR, IT) fall under it.
- **Policies and tasks assigned at the Global Root** are inherited by all subgroups **unless inheritance is broken**.
- It's like the master template — changes here affect everything downstream **by default**.

---

### **2. What Happens if You Change a Policy and It Causes a Lot of Errors?**

If a policy change causes issues across many systems (e.g., blocks access, crashes apps, breaks services), here's how to fix it:

---

#### **A. Revert to a Previous Policy**

1. Go to **Menu > Policy > Policy Catalog**.
2. Select the product and locate the **previous version** (or your original policy).
3. Go to **System Tree**, choose the affected group(s).
4. In the **Assigned Policies** tab, reassign the old/stable policy.
5. Save it. The Trellix Agent will pull the updated policy during the next communication interval (or force it manually).

---

#### **B. Use Policy Rollback (if you saved a copy)**

- Always **clone and test** policies before mass rollout.
- If you **cloned** the original policy before making changes, just reassign the cloned "safe" one.
- If not — you may need to manually reconfigure the settings or use a backup if you have one.

---

#### **C. Force Agent to Update Immediately (Emergency Fix)**

On affected endpoints:
1. Open **Trellix Agent Status Monitor** (`CmdAgent.exe`).
2. Click **Collect and Send Props** or run this in command line:
   ```
   cmdagent.exe /p /e
   ```
   - `/p` = Pull new policy
   - `/e` = Enforce policy

This forces the agent to update immediately rather than waiting for its scheduled interval.

---

#### **D. Use Tags or Dynamic Groups to Limit Blast Radius**

In the future:
- **Test changes** on systems in a special test group.
- Tag a few machines with "Testing", create a policy assignment rule for them.
- Roll out gradually before touching the Global Root.

---

#### **E. Export/Backup Policies Regularly**

Before making big changes:
- Export policies: Go to **Policy Catalog > Export**.
- This gives you a backup you can re-import if needed.

---

### TL;DR:

- **Global Root** is the top-level source of policy inheritance.
- If you make a bad change: **reassign old policy**, **force agents to update**, or **roll back using a clone/export**.
- Best practice: **Always test on a few machines before applying to production**.
