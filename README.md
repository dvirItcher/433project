Blocking only PsExec packets specifically can be challenging because PsExec, part of the Sysinternals Suite, uses legitimate network protocols (SMB) for remote administration. However, you can focus on identifying and blocking its unique behavior. Here's a step-by-step approach:

---

### **1. Understand PsExec Communication**
- **Default Protocol:** SMB (TCP port 445).
- **Key Artifact:** PsExec uses a service (`PSEXESVC`) that it uploads to the target machine during execution.
- **Traffic Pattern:** It sends an executable file to the target machine and communicates with the created service.

---

### **2. Methods to Block PsExec Traffic**

#### **A. Use a Firewall**
- Block traffic based on:
  - **SMB Traffic:** If SMB isn't needed for certain hosts, block TCP port 445.
  - **Process-specific Rules:** Some advanced firewalls (like Palo Alto or Cisco) allow blocking based on specific executables or processes.

#### **B. Detect and Block PsExec Service (Deep Packet Inspection)**
1. **DPI (Deep Packet Inspection):** Use a firewall or IDS/IPS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) that inspects SMB traffic for the keyword `PSEXESVC` in packets.
2. Create a custom signature for PsExec:
   - For **Snort**, add a rule:
     ```plaintext
     alert tcp any any -> any 445 (content:"PSEXESVC"; msg:"PsExec Traffic Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
     ```
   - Similar rules can be adapted for Suricata.

#### **C. Prevent Uploading PsExec Files**
- Monitor for `.exe` files being written via SMB.
- Block or flag unusual SMB writes:
  - Look for executable filenames like `PSEXESVC.exe`.

#### **D. Disable SMBv1 (Optional)**
- PsExec relies on SMB, and some versions may still attempt to use SMBv1. Disabling SMBv1 reduces attack surfaces but may affect older systems.
  - **Windows Command:**
    ```powershell
    Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol
    ```

### **3. Monitor for PsExec Activity**
- Use a SIEM or log analyzer (like Splunk) to look for:
  - Authentication attempts with default admin accounts.
  - Event IDs:
    - **Windows Event ID 7045:** New service installed.
    - **Event ID 4688:** Process creation (look for `psexec.exe`).

---

### **4. Block by Behavior**
- Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) to block execution of `psexec.exe` based on:
  - **Hash:** Prevent known PsExec binaries.
  - **Behavior:** Flag remote code execution attempts.

---

### **5. Alternative: Configure Group Policies**
- Disable the ability to create new services remotely:
  - Go to **Group Policy Management** → Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → Security Options.
  - Set **"Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and subpaths"** to block access.

---

By combining these methods, you can specifically block PsExec traffic without affecting legitimate SMB communication.
